# Object-Detection-Classification
Object Detection and classification pipeline. In this project, I implemented edge detection to create bounding boxes around animals in a scene. Then, after training a Convolutional Neural Network model, I was able to classify the animals in the scene and display the classification label with about 75% accuracy.

You can pull the code and run the Jupyter Notebook called model_training.ipynb.
